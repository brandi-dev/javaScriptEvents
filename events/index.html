    <!-- Inline events not ideal and should not use -->
    <p>Inline Event Button, not ideal.</p>
    <button onclick="alert('YOU CLICKED BUTTON #1!')">Click Me!</button>

    <!-- Setting a property to be a function. The function will be called
    by the browser once the event happens. -->
    <p>JavaScript event button. This is a little better because we are writing 
        the code in javaScript.</p>
    <button id='v2'>Click Me 2!</button>

    <!-- addEventListener -->
    <p>addEventListener is better because you can have as many different call backs as you want for one event
        It is also better because you can pass in other options.</p>
    <button id='v3'>Click Me 3!</button>
